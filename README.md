# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
In this project we will build credit card fraud detection classifier using python.

## Objective 
<ul>
<li>We are going to make a classifier to check the fraud detection (that is, anomaly in the dataset)</li>
<li>Hence, in this project we will build credit card fraud detection classifier using python.</li>
</ul>

## Need for the project 
<ul>
<li>The companies are sharp-eyed about detecting all the anomalies in fraud detection because they do not want the customer to suffer for any illegal transactions just because somebody else can get away with it .</li>
<li>Hence , these companies make sure that they are keeping track of all the data and they are able to identify the illegal transactions, also known as fraud transactions.</li>
</ul>

## Major steps followed :-
<li>Preparing dataset</li>
<li>Choosing algorithm.</li>
<li>Train algorithm with the training data.</li>
<li>Evaluation of the model.</li>
<li>Make prediction on the new data.</li>

## Description
<li>First of all,  we will import the concerned libraries like - pandas , matplotlib.pyplot , seaborn and numpy.</li>
<li>We explore the data by writing data.head() and data.columns and also , 
data visualization is done to get the general idea about the dataset.</li>
<li>Now , we will import LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection , that is we chose logistic regression model for training our dataset.</li>
<li>Evaluation -
import confusion_matrix, classification_report,accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics we achieved the accuracy_score of 0.999
</li>
<li>Making Predictions- 
We make predictions to evaluate the model and also the model makes correct prediction.
</li>

## Conclusion
So by following the steps described, we built the credit card fraud detection classifier using python.
